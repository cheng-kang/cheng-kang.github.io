Pauseable Timer is a pause-able timer written in Swift.

There are occassions when we need timers to pause, however, this feature is not implemented in Timer(Swift3). Thus, after some failed attempts, I create this pause-able timer which hopefully could be useful to you.

## How to Use
1. Create a Timer

	```
	e.g.
	let timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 10, target: self, selector: aSelector, userInfo: nil, repeats: true)
	```

2. Create a Pauseable Timer and pass the timer as an argument.

	```
	e.g.
	let pauseableTimer = PauseableTimer(timer: timer)
	```

3. Pause and Resume!
	
	```
	e.g.
	pauseableTimer.pause()
	pauseableTimer.resume()
	```

**Notice**

- If the timer you use to initialize a PauseableTimer is not scheduled (or added to RunLoop) already, you need to manually schedule it (ro add it to RunLoop). You can do it by `RunLoop.current.add(timer, forMode: .commonModes)`. 
- Use `timer` property of PauseableTimer if you need to manipulate the timer or get it’s properties. Like this `pauseableTimer.timer.firedate = Date()`.
- A convinient method `invalidate()` is created to invalidate the timer.

## Intro
Pauseable Timer does not re-implement Timer in Swift, but takes a Timer as a property and implement 'Pause' feature with the help of it.

The concept of this feature is inspired by [NSTimer 总结1(包括计时器不准的解决)](http://www.jianshu.com/p/e554a164d0da). 

The main idea is `set the firedate of Timer to a un-reachable date when you want it pause (the timer will wait until forever and you can take it as pausing :D), and set it back to its original firedate when you want it resume (and the timer will fire "as expected").`

Simple and Excellent!

You might have noticed the double qouted "as expected". Acctually, this might fail your expectation because

1.  The firedate is expried.

	```
	e.g.
	The current time is 2017.01.04 10:25.
	The original firedate is 2017.01.04 10:30.
	You pause the timer at this moment and resume it 10 mins after which is 2017.01.04 10:35. So the timer has missed it's expected firedate. 
	However it will fire once you set the firedate back to 2017.01.04 10:30 at 2017.01.04 10:35, if the timer is already added to RunLoop.
	```

2. The timer is expected to wait for the remaining waiting time.

	```
	e.g.
	The current time is 2017.01.04 10:25:00.
	The timeInterval of the timer is 60 seconds. It's scheduled at this moment, and should fire 60 seconds later at 2017.01.04 10:26:00.
	And for some reason you pause it 10 seconds after, which is 2017.01.04 10:25:10. And you resume the timer at 2017.01.04 10:25:50.
	However, you still want it to fire 60 seconds after it's scheduled, regardless the pausing part. So it should wait for 50 seconds more and fire at 2017.01.04 10:26:40.
	```

An ideal solution should be one that fits all 3 conditions (another one is the condition that someone doesn’t care if the original firedate is expired or not) discussed above. However, this project only deals with condition 2 because that is the problem I encountered with.

Hopefully, I will continue this small project in the future and complete it with solutions to every condition.
